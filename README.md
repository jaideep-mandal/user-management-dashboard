# User Management Dashboard

This project is a **User Management Dashboard** built to manage users' details through a simple, intuitive web interface. The app allows users to **view**, **add**, **edit**, and **delete** users. It interacts with a mock backend API (`JSONPlaceholder`) to simulate real-world functionality.

## Features

- **View Users**: Displays a list of users fetched from the mock backend API.
- **Add Users**: Allows the addition of new users via a form.
- **Edit Users**: Provides the functionality to edit existing user details.
- **Delete Users**: Allows users to delete records from the system.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all form fields are filled before submitting.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users in case of any issues with fetching, adding, or deleting users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (for styling)
